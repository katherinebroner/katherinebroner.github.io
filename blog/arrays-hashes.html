        <h2>Arrays and Hashes</h2>
        <section>
          <p><b>What is an array?</b></p>
          <p>An array represents a list of items that can contain any type of Ruby object. Some types of Ruby objects in incldue strings, integers, and other arrays. Arrays are beneficial because it allows the programmer to store information of the same type of content in one list.  In order to access an item in the list, an index number is assigned, beginning at 0 for the first item. The example below represents an array, where index 0 = "Katherine", index 1 = "Kevin", and index 2 = "Ben".</p>
          <p>my_index = [Katherine", "Kevin", "Ben"]</p>
          <p> Arrays are very powerful in Ruby because a programmer can iterate (go through each item) in the array to perform a multitude of tasks, such as creating sentences or performing calculations. At any time, the user can add, delete, or rename items in the array. An even more specific type of list is a hash, which is the next topic.

          <p> A hash is a collection of items that can be stored in pairs. Hashes are very similar to dictionaries, in that there is a key that defines the particular value, expressed as {key => value}. Like arrays, a hash can contain any type of Ruby object. One particularity of hashes is that the key must be unique and cannot be repeated in the hash. The example below represents a hash, where the key is used to access the value. Below, index "credit" = "Katherine", index "support" = "Kevin", and index "support" = "Ben".</p>
          <p>my_hash = {"credit" => "Katherine", "support" => "Kevin", "sales" => "Ben"}</p>
          <p>Hashes are one of the most powerful tools in Ruby because of the ability to customize the data. Like arrays, hashes can be split to create sentences or perform specific calculations. At any time, the user can add, remove, or replace items in the hash. Generally, it is better to use hashes because the data is more specific and easier to access when writing code.</p>
