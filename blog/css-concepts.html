      <h2>Classes vs IDs</h2>
      <h3>February 7, 2016</h3>
      <section>
        <p><b>What are two attributes that allow designers to uniquely style elements in a webpage?</b><p>
        <p>In HTML and CSS, designers and programmers strive to be as specific as possible when writing their code.  Many different semantic tags can be used to designate the header, footer, section, paragraph and many other elements in a webpage.  Within CSS, designers have a plethora of options, choosing everything from font style, background color, border design, table margins, text positioning and more.</p>
        <p>Two attributes that allow designers to uniquely style elements in a webpage are classes and ids.  Classes should be applied when the designer has several elements that require the same styling.  This class can be used repeatedly, which sames time and allows for code to be written efficiently.  On the opposite end of the spectrum, id's are applied when the designer has only one element that should be styled differently from the rest of the content in the webpage.  The specificity of id's ensures that a specific style is adhered to and cannot be applied to other elements.</p>

        <p><b>What are the best practices associated with classes?</b></p>
        <p>When deciding on a whether or not to create a class, the first question a developer should ask is, "Will these style elements be applied to other areas of my website?"  Some of the common elements in a particular class could be related to font style, font color, or border design.  Once this decision is made, the developer will need to pick a short name for the attribute, which should reference the content or styling.  In HTML, the code would be written as such:
          <!--<p class="special-message">Special Message from Management: Be sure to always create a feature branch before beggining your work!</p> --> </p>
        <p>Based on the example above, when the "special-message" class is referenced in CSS, the styling will be linked to this section.  Because this is a class and can be used repeatedly, a special message in a different section of the code can also be referced using the same class attribute.  Once all attributes are completed in HTML, the styling in CSS would be written as follows:
          .special-message {
            font-color: red;
            font-weight: bold;
        }
        As a result, any items noted with the special-message class will be bold and in red.  Classes are a very efficient was to repeat styling throughout a webpage.</p>

      <section>
        <p><b>What are the best practices associated with id's</b></p>
        <p>As an alternative to classes, id's are used when a developer only wants to style on unique section of content.  Only one id can be attributed to a particular section, which prevents the possibility of repetition.  Like a class, the styling could be related to different font sizes or styles and background colors.  The decision lies completely with the designer to choose how to uniquely represent the content.  In HTML, the code would be written as such:
          <!--<p id="special-message>"Special Message from Management: Be sure to always create a feature branch before beggining your work!</p> --> </p>
        <p>Based on the example above, when the "special-message" id is referenced in CSS, the styling will be linked to this section.  Remember, this id is only used to reference this one particular "special-message" id, making it easy to identify on the webpage.  The styling in CSS would be written as follows:
          #special-message {
            font-color: red;
            font-weight: bold;
        }
        As a result, only the "special-message" id content would be in bold and red.  While there are many options to choose from in HTML and CSS, class and id attributes are an excellent way to save time and style code.</p>
