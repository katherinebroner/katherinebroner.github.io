<!-- Reflection

  How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

  I enjoyed the process of wireframing with my partner because we were able to discuss different ideas and I was able to think of new options for my webpage. It was helpful to create the HTML page together because we were able to discuss different tag options and the structure of the code. My partner was also able to point out where I missed a closing tag which was  helpful to have another person reviewing my code.

  Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

  Yes, I find wireframing very helpful for my development process. I enjoy exploring my creative side and coming up with different website designs. Balsamiq, the wireframing tool I used, was very easy to follow and there was a wide range of options. I enjoy being able to put my ideas on paper and make revisions throughout the process.

  What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

  My pair and I discussed the benefits of keeping the wireframe simple. We were able to keep the structure fairly basic in order to have a starting template that can be modified in the future. We also discussed the importance of the user being able to access different tabs/pages quickly without having to go back to the Home screen.

  What new semantic elements did you learn about?

  I learned about <nav>, which is useful for when you are creating navigation links. I also learned about <main> and <section> which is a helpful way to strucure your code and understand how everything should be organized.
