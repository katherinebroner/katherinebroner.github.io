          <p>Welcome to my website! I hope you enjoy reading through my blogs and projects - as a new programmer, understanding the basics is essential!</p>
          <p>I am originally from the beautify city of San Francisco, and have recently made the move to New York City. The opportunity to explore tech in both cities is very exciting.</p>
          <p>Besides coding, I have many other interests and hobbies. I love art history and you will regularly see me exploring the art galleries at musuems. Tapping into my creative side, I also enjoy dancing (aspiring swing dancer) and attending concerts in the city. To relax, I love to spend time outdoors and find the sunniest spot at the park. Adding yoga to my weekly routine also allows me to keep my brain fresh for new coding challenges!</p>
          <p>For my education, I studied finance at the University of San Francisco. Through school, I was able to develop strong analytical skills and learned how to work on teams. I pursued my interest in computer programming in the summer of 2015, when I enrolled in a part-time Python course. After discovering my passion for programming, I became a full-time student at Dev Bootcamp and love having the opportunity to learn something new on a daily basis.</p>
          <p>One quirk about me is that I love adult coloring books! Coloring brings me back to my childhood and is a great way to relieve stess after a long day. I always love finding new ways to explore my creativity!</p>
